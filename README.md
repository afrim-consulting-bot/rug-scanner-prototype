# Rug Scanner (Prototype)

Front-end UX/UI prototype for **Rug Scanner** risk reports (Solana).

- Fake data only (no real chain scanning yet)
- Flow included:
  - Scan → Report
  - Share Risk Report (copies unguessable link)
  - Shared report page (summary-first + expand)

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- This is intentionally scoped to the MVP PRD.
- Next iterations should focus on polish, clarity, and bugfixes — not new features.
